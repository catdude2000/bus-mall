## About Me, Again

This site displays faux products for users to select, and generates three new randomized products each time a product's picture is clicked on.  After choosing 25 times, the user can click the "view results" button to see the number of times each product was shown and how many times it was selected.  Clicking "view chart" will bring these results up in the form of a bar chart.  If the page is refreshed, clicking "view previous results" will bring up the results that were there before the page refreshed.
